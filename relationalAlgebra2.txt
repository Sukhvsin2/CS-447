Renaming Operator:
  - Useful to rename an attributte or relation when performing operations.
  - Avoid cumbersome names when relations have identical attributes
  - Denoted ρA1, A2, A3,.....An(R) for relation R
  - Denote the operation ρs(R)
  Example:
    Syntax : ρ(newName1, newName2, newName3)(TableName)
             ρ(type. range, yr)(Tesla_cars)
    
Restricting Relations:
  - Key Contraints
    1) A key Atrributes is one or more attributes that are unique in the relation.
    2) Key may be single attribute in a relation.
    3) Key may be 2 or more attribute in a relation.
    4) We constcted all pairs of tuples in a relation, no pair may agree....... check ppt*
    
  - Referential Integreity Constraints
    1) Value of an attribute in one relation must appear generally in an another relation but 
      could also be in same relation.
    2) Often used to connect tuples across relations.
    Example:
      Syntax: π#tablename(2ndTableName) ⊆ π#colName(2tbColName)
              π#battery(Tesla_Cars) ⊆ π#size(Ev_battery_size)
