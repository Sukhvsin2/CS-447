 Relation Algebra
  Operations: Union, Intersection, Diffrence
  Operations that Removes parts: Selection(Rows) and Projection(Columns)
  Operations that Combines parts: Cartesian product and "join" operations
  Rename operations: Renames the realation schema that concludes table name or attributes.
  
  Rules:
    R & S have to be schema which are identical 
  
 Union: R ∪ U
 {a,b,c} ∪ {b,c,d} -> {a,b,c,d}
 
 Interseaction: R ∩ S
 {a,b,c} ∩ {b,c,d} -> {b,c}
 
 Diffrence: R \ S
 {a,b,c} \ {b,c,d} -> {a}

 Projection:
  - Produces a subset S from R one or more of Rs attributes are included in s.
  - Denoted π A1, A2,.......An(R) where Ai represents the ith attribute.
  Example: πName (R)
            Name
            Carrie Fisher
            Mark Hammill
            
           πName, Birthday (R)
            Name            Birthday
            Carrie Fisher   ////
            Mark Hammill    ////
  
  Selection:
   - Produces a subset of S of R where S contains tuples of R that satisfy some condition C.
   - C is a conditional expression
   - Denoted σc(R)
   Example: σBirthdate > 01/01/70(S)
            Name          Address BirthDate
            Mark Hammill  ////    ///
  
  Cartesian Product
    - Produces all pairs of tuples from the sets R and S.
    (row 1 of R with all rows of S,
     row 2 of R with all rows of S,
     ...)
    - Denoted R x S
    Example: R x S
             R.Name           R.Address       R.Birthdate   R.Name           R.Address       R.Birthdate

  Natural Join:
    - Produces a relation of pares of tuples from R and S that have one or more attributes that match
    - Resuling Paring is called a Joined Tuple
    - Denoted R ⋈ S
    Example: R ⋈ S check out PPT
    
    
  Theta Join:
    - Produces a relation of pares of tuples from R and S that have one or more attributes that match on condition
    - Denoted R ⋈c S
    - Select tuples that Satisfy C
    Example: R ⋈max_speed > 200 S check out PPT
             Trains x Planes (PPT*)
             1. Cross Product
             2. Compare Maxspeed in table should be  >= 200
             
  Combining Operations:
    - Just like mathematical algebra allows up to combine operations, relational algeba to combine operations
    - Use raenthese to indicate order of operations.
    
  Question Example:
    πTitle, year(σlength > 100(Movies) ∩ σstudio="Fox"(Studios))
